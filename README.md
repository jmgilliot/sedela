Description

Cozy-Portfolio is a Cozy Cloud application which allows you to do a portfolio. This application was started as a student project of CÃ©dric PATCHANE from Telecom Bretagne, you can read more about that in the wiki.

Here are the main features :

Grab documents and information from a DoYouBuzz account (API keys required but free and easy to get, see here)
Grab badges from an OpenBadges backpack
Display a public view of the portfolio (only documents selected by the user will be visible)
Give to the user the entire control about his data : what information, what badge, what document should be displayed on his pubic portfolio page or not
For this last point, all profile information and documents/badges will have a dedicated checkbox. If this checkbox is grey that means your document won't be displayed. If it's green, the document will be displayed on your portfolio public page.

Hack

Hacking the portfolio app requires you the dev environment (see the tutorial from Cozy Cloud). After that you can enjoy hacking the portfolio as you want.

$ git clone https://github.com/CPatchane/cozy-portfolio.git
$ npm install
$ cd client
$ npm install
You can find more details about setting up your dev environment and install the application in the wiki.

Development

With your dev environment started, you can start the server:

$ node server.js
Then (in a new terminal) start the brunch watcher to recompile and to reload the front-end app in your browser each time you make a change:

$ cd client
$ brunch watch
And finally you deploy your app in you dev environment:

$ cozy-dev deploy 9250
You can also find more details about that in the wiki.
